Deciding which graduate school you're going to spend the next _n_ years of your
life is going to be one of the hardest decision of your life. One of the things
that made is particularly hard for me was deciding between Cornell and my other
top choices was Cornell's "Free agent system". Here is a short post about what
the system is and why it worked for me.

#### How do grad schools work?

For most schools in the US, when you apply to a PhD program, you are usually
picked out by one or more professors who think you'd be a good fit. After
visiting the school, the student decides which professor they want to work with
and commit to the school. When the student starts at the school, they are
funded by the professor and they start doing great things together. However,
some schools don't follow this system.

#### Cornell's Free Agent System

At Cornell, and a few other schools, the admission process looks a bit
different.  When a PhD student is admitted to Cornell, they are are _admitted
to the department_, which highlights Cornell's commitment towards the student's
academic freedom. Concretely, this means that Cornell guarantees funding,
usually through teaching assistantship, for the student without tying them to
an advisor [^1].  This is supposed to allow the students to explore and talk to
potential advisors without being worried about funding. This is the Free Agent
system at Cornell. Students are free agents till they decide who they want to
work with.

#### The Problem

Cornell's free agent system was devised when the department was young and the
incoming PhD students tended to have comparatively less research experience.
The free agent system allowed students to explore different areas without
being pressured into working on topics they might disliked. However, in the recent
years, the makeup of people applying to PhD programs has drastically changed ---
students tend to come in with a lot more research experience and are usually
quite certain about the area they want to work in.

Furthermore, the CS department is also structured in a way that assumes
students are free agents their first year. This means that they are expected to
~~take a lot of classes and~~ [^2] be teaching assistants (TAs) in their first
two semesters.


#### My Experience

The free agent system was the biggest reason that caused me to delay my
decision.  For some background, I started doing programming languages (PL)
research in the first semester of my undergraduate degree and was certain about
the kind of research I wanted to pursue in grad school. Furthermore, I knew
that Cornell was the best fit for my interest in doing PL work at the
intersection of other fields.

Unfortunately, I was also afraid of not being able to find an advisor and
wanted to choose a school where I knew I had an advisor. After about 6 hours of
post visit-day talks with professors and students in the PL group, I decided to
go to Cornell. Even after my acceptance, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to find
an advisor.

When I started in Fall, I emailed several professors in the PL group and setup
meetings. This is where I found the true strength of the free agent system.
Since professors expect students to go talk to a lot of people, they expect and
often encourage students to do research rotations with professors they are interested in working with.
It also makes it easy to reach out to professors and learn about their
work. I cannot overstate how important it is to me to learn about and have
conversations about research in different domains. One of my goals going into a PhD is
to have a broad sense of the different kinds of problems in different domains
and having access to professors in different areas makes it very easy to do so.

I was also able to start working with my awesome advisor [Adrian
Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) and we quickly found a project
I'm passionate about.

#### Caveat Emptor

While the free agent system caused me some anguish in the decision process, it
was not the primary reason I decided join Cornell.

- Research that excited me, and people [^3] who are just as excited about it as
  me were my primary motivators.
- The first year TA problem is non-trivial and causes some amount of stress for
  new grad students. However, the department is aware of the issues and is
  trying to move away from this system.

Finally, here is a more [detailed

on schools. Good luck!

[^1]: Being tied to an advisor is not always a bad thing. In fact, most people decide on an _advisor_ and not a _school_.

[^2]: The CS department recently overhauled the course requirement to drastically reduce the number of classes and restrictions on which classes to take.

[^3]: Importantly, This includes other grad students. Remember, you're going to be spending a lot more time with other grad students than you will with faculty.
